# Reset-Graphics
Powershell script to reset your graphics driver.

This was written to address a repeating issue I had with G-Sync after I disconnected from a remote desktop session to my computer and running any games caused them to get locked at 24 FPS.

I just wanted to automate the process of going to device manager and disabling/enabling my Nvidia GPU because I'm lazy.
